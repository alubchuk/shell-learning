# Module 8: Essential Command-Line Tools

This module covers essential command-line tools and networking commands that are crucial for system administration and text processing.

## File Operations

### find
- Basic syntax and usage
- Search by name, type, size, and time
- Execute commands on found files
- Complex search patterns
- Performance considerations

### touch
- Create new files
- Update timestamps
- Batch file creation
- Access and modification times
- Common use cases

## Text Processing Tools

### tr (translate)
- Character translation
- Character deletion
- Squeezing repeating characters
- Case conversion
- Common text transformations

### cut
- Field extraction
- Delimiter-based cutting
- Character-based cutting
- Byte-based cutting
- Integration with other tools

## Networking Commands

### Basic Networking
- ping: Network connectivity testing
- netstat: Network statistics
- ifconfig/ip: Network interface configuration
- route: Routing table management
- nslookup/dig: DNS queries

### Advanced Networking
- curl/wget: File transfer and web requests
- ssh: Secure shell connections
- scp/rsync: Secure file transfer
- nc (netcat): Network utility
- tcpdump: Network packet analysis
