# Module 7: Advanced Scripting Patterns

This module covers advanced shell scripting patterns, design principles, testing strategies, and best practices for creating maintainable and reliable scripts.

## Design Patterns

### Command Pattern
- Encapsulating commands as objects
- Command-line interface design
- Subcommand architecture
- Plugin systems

### Observer Pattern
- Event handling
- Callback functions
- Asynchronous execution
- Event logging

### Factory Pattern
- Dynamic object creation
- Configuration-based initialization
- Resource management
- Plugin loading

### Singleton Pattern
- Global state management
- Resource locking
- Configuration management
- Process synchronization

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Modular design
- Library creation
- Configuration management
- Documentation standards

### Error Handling
- Defensive programming
- Input validation
- Error propagation
- Recovery strategies

### Performance
- Resource optimization
- Caching strategies
- Process management
- Memory usage

### Security
- Input sanitization
- Privilege management
- Secure data handling
- Audit logging

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing
- Test frameworks
- Test organization
- Mocking
- Assertions

### Integration Testing
- System interaction
- Environment setup
- Test data management
- Cleanup procedures

### Performance Testing
- Load testing
- Stress testing
- Resource monitoring
- Benchmarking

### Security Testing
- Vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing
- Code analysis
- Compliance checking
