# Module 13: Linux OS and Kernel Internals

This module covers fundamental concepts of Linux operating system internals, kernel operations, and essential system administration commands. Each concept is explained in detail to help you understand how Linux works under the hood.

## Topics Covered

### Kernel Basics
The kernel is the core of the operating system that manages hardware resources and provides essential services to applications.

- **Kernel Architecture**: The Linux kernel uses a monolithic architecture where all core functions (process management, memory management, file systems, device drivers) run in kernel space. It's modular, allowing components to be loaded/unloaded at runtime.

- **System Calls**: These are the interface between user applications and kernel services. When an application needs to perform privileged operations (like reading a file or creating a process), it makes a system call. Common system calls include:
  - `read()/write()`: File operations
  - `fork()/exec()`: Process creation
  - `mmap()`: Memory mapping
  - `socket()`: Network operations

- **Module Management**: Linux can dynamically load/unload kernel modules (drivers, file systems) without rebooting. Key commands:
  - `lsmod`: List loaded modules
  - `modprobe`: Load a module
  - `rmmod`: Remove a module

- **Boot Process**: The sequence from power-on to user space:
  1. BIOS/UEFI initialization
  2. Bootloader (GRUB) loads kernel
  3. Kernel initialization
  4. Init system (systemd) starts user space

- **Device Drivers**: Software that allows the kernel to communicate with hardware devices. Types include:
  - Character devices (keyboards, serial ports)
  - Block devices (disks, SSDs)
  - Network devices (network cards)

- **Interrupt Handling**: How the kernel responds to hardware and software events:
  - Hardware interrupts (device signals)
  - Software interrupts (system calls)
  - Interrupt handlers (ISRs)

### Memory Management
How the kernel manages system memory and provides memory isolation between processes.

- **Virtual Memory**: Provides each process with its own address space, separated from physical memory:
  - Process sees continuous memory space
  - Physical memory can be fragmented
  - Enables memory protection between processes

- **Page Tables**: Data structures that map virtual addresses to physical addresses:
  - Multiple levels of translation
  - TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) for caching
  - Page faults handle missing mappings

- **Swap Space**: Extended memory using disk space:
  - Allows running more processes than physical RAM
  - Moves least-used pages to disk
  - Managed by the kernel swapper

- **Memory Mapping**: Associates file contents with process memory:
  - Efficient file I/O
  - Shared libraries
  - Inter-process communication

- **OOM Killer**: Out Of Memory Killer protects system stability:
  - Activates when memory is critically low
  - Selects processes to terminate
  - Based on badness score algorithm

- **Memory Pressure**: System state when memory resources are constrained:
  - Triggers various reclaim mechanisms
  - Affects system performance
  - Monitored via pressure stall information (PSI)

### Process Management
How the kernel manages and schedules running programs.

- **Process Scheduling**: Determines which process runs on CPU:
  - Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)
  - Real-time schedulers
  - Load balancing across CPUs

- **Context Switching**: Switching between processes:
  - Save current process state
  - Load new process state
  - Manage CPU registers and memory maps

- **Priority Management**: Process execution priority:
  - Nice values (-20 to 19)
  - Real-time priorities
  - Dynamic priority adjustment

- **CPU Affinity**: Binding processes to specific CPUs:
  - Improves cache utilization
  - Better NUMA performance
  - Load distribution control

- **Cgroups**: Control groups for resource management:
  - CPU time limits
  - Memory limits
  - I/O bandwidth control
  - Hierarchical organization

- **Namespaces**: Process isolation features:
  - PID namespace (process IDs)
  - Network namespace (network stack)
  - Mount namespace (filesystems)
  - User namespace (user IDs)

### File System
How the kernel manages files and storage.

- **VFS (Virtual File System)**: Abstract layer for different filesystems:
  - Common interface for all filesystems
  - Supports local and network filesystems
  - Handles file operations uniformly

- **Inodes and Dentries**: Core filesystem structures:
  - Inodes: File metadata (permissions, size)
  - Dentries: Directory entries and hierarchy
  - Cache for performance

- **File System Types**: Different filesystem implementations:
  - ext4: Standard Linux filesystem
  - XFS: High-performance filesystem
  - Btrfs: Modern copy-on-write filesystem
  - Network filesystems (NFS, SMB)

- **Mount Points**: Filesystem attachment points:
  - Hierarchical structure
  - Mount options and flags
  - Bind mounts and overlays

- **Block I/O**: Disk operation management:
  - I/O schedulers
  - Read-ahead
  - Write-back caching

- **Buffer Cache**: Memory cache for disk blocks:
  - Reduces disk access
  - Write combining
  - Dirty page writeback

### Network Stack
How the kernel handles network communications.

- **Protocol Layers**: Implementation of network protocols:
  - Physical and Data Link (drivers)
  - Network (IP)
  - Transport (TCP/UDP)
  - Socket layer

- **Socket Interface**: Network programming API:
  - Stream sockets (TCP)
  - Datagram sockets (UDP)
  - Raw sockets
  - Unix domain sockets

- **Network Devices**: Network interface management:
  - Device drivers
  - Interface configuration
  - Traffic queuing

- **Routing**: Network packet routing:
  - Routing tables
  - Policy routing
  - Multipath routing

- **Packet Filtering**: Network security:
  - Netfilter framework
  - iptables/nftables rules
  - Connection tracking

- **Network Namespaces**: Network stack isolation:
  - Virtual networks
  - Container networking
  - Network virtualization

### System Resources
How the kernel manages and allocates system resources.

- **CPU Management**: Processor resource control:
  - Frequency scaling
  - Power management
  - Core isolation

- **Memory Allocation**: Memory resource management:
  - Slab allocator
  - Huge pages
  - Memory compaction

- **I/O Scheduling**: Disk access optimization:
  - CFQ (Completely Fair Queuing)
  - Deadline scheduler
  - BFQ (Budget Fair Queuing)

- **Resource Limits**: Process resource constraints:
  - ulimit settings
  - cgroup limits
  - System-wide limits

- **System Calls**: Kernel service interface:
  - System call table
  - System call overhead
  - System call filtering

- **Performance Tuning**: System optimization:
  - Kernel parameters
  - Sysctl settings
  - Performance monitoring
