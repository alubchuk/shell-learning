# Module 12: Process Management

This module covers process management in Unix-like systems, including process creation, monitoring, control, and inter-process communication.

## Topics Covered

### Process Basics
- Process lifecycle
- Process states (running, sleeping, stopped, zombie)
- Process hierarchy (parent-child relationships)
- Process groups and sessions
- Job control

### Process Control
- Starting processes
- Background and foreground jobs
- Process signals
- Process priority (nice)
- Resource limits (ulimit)

### Process Monitoring
- Process status (ps)
- System activity reporter (sar)
- Process accounting
- Resource usage (time)
- Memory usage

### Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
- Pipes and named pipes (FIFOs)
- Signals
- Shared memory
- Message queues
- Semaphores

### Resource Management
- CPU scheduling
- Memory management
- I/O management
- Load balancing
- Resource monitoring
